          Tables are so hard to write. So I'll code one everyday to resume my
          learned things. Also I've learned a little more about how JS is
          interpreted by the browser. See

          Tables aren't so terrific to write. I'm going to add JavaScript to
          avoid a too long HTML code. So, 1pm, I'm going to eat with Guillaume
          and after lunch have to take a decision for storing my data.
